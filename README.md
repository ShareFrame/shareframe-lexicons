# ShareFrame Lexicon Repository

This repository contains the lexicon definitions for the ShareFrame platform, a decentralized media-sharing application built on the AT Protocol. Lexicons define the data structures used for posts, profiles, interactions, and other data within the ShareFrame ecosystem.

## Overview

Lexicons are essential for ensuring data consistency and interoperability within the ShareFrame network. They provide a standardized way to represent and exchange information between different components of the platform.

## Contents

This repository includes the following lexicon definitions:

-   **`social.shareframe.feed.post.json`**: Defines the structure for feed posts, including text, media, location, and metadata.
-   **`social.shareframe.profile.json`**: Defines the structure for user profiles, including display names, bios, avatars, and other user-related information.
-   **`social.shareframe.like.json`**: Defines the structure for "like" interactions on posts.
-   **`social.shareframe.follow.json`**: Defines the structure for user follow relationships.
-   **`social.shareframe.repost.json`**: Defines the structure for reposted content.

## Usage

These lexicon definitions are intended to be used by:

-   **ShareFrame Developers**: To implement data models and APIs that conform to the ShareFrame standards.
-   **Third-Party Developers**: To build applications and services that interact with the ShareFrame platform.
-   **Community Members**: To understand the data structures used within the ShareFrame ecosystem.
